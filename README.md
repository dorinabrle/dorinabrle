# Dorina Buehrle

Business operator at the tech-commercial interface. I turn brilliant technology into commercial success.

## What I Do

I'm CRO/CFO at Lemony, where we're currently building Cascadeflow - stay tuned! coming early November.

Beyond that, I work as a fractional CFO for startups (mostly Swiss-based), helping them design business models and go-to-market strategies that actually work. Over the past years, I've coached more than 200 startups on everything from open core models to consumption-based pricing to developer-first growth and fundraising.

I have a PhD in Business Innovation, which is a fancy way of saying I've spent years researching how great technology becomes commercial success—and why so much brilliant tech fails to reach the market it deserves.

## Why I'm Here

The best technology succeeds when developers build what works, business models support innovation, and commercial strategy matches technical excellence. I'm on GitHub because I believe open source wins, and I want to create resources that bridge the gap between tech, business, and market.

## Current Projects

**Cascadeflow** - stay tuned

**awesome-tech-to-business** – A collection of resources for turning technology into commercial success: business model templates, GTM frameworks, and translation tools. (Coming soon)

**awesome-open-core-business-models** – Business model playbooks and pricing strategies from companies like GitLab, Elastic, and MongoDB. (Coming soon)

## Previous Work

Throughout my career, I've worked at the intersection of technology and business strategy:

**Founder and CEO** - co-founded, ran and scaled a startup in Switzerland, grew the team to 45, offices in Germany and US, raised $20M from European and leading SF VCs. 

**Startup Ecosystem Builder** – Center for Entrepreneurship (HSG), Innosuisse, and programs at Venturelab (Swiss startup accelerators), where I coached hundreds of early-stage companies through business model design, fundraising, and go-to-market strategy.

**Academic Research** – My PhD research focused on how startups translate technical innovation into viable business models and particularly their team backgrounds. 

**Corporate Innovation** – Advised corporates on how to evaluate and partner with startups, including due diligence frameworks for open source technologies and technical risk assessment.

**Fractional CFO** – Served as interim/fractional CFO for Swiss startups in fintech, healthtech, and enterprise software, helping them bridge from product-market fit to commercial scale.

## How I Help

I design business models (open core, freemium, consumption-based pricing), build go-to-market strategies that convert GitHub stars into paying customers, translate technical specifications into business value propositions, and create frameworks that work—ROI calculators, pricing matrices, evaluation rubrics.

## Let's Connect

I'm open to fractional CFO engagements, startup coaching on business models, GTM and fundraising, and conversations about commercial strategy or open source business models.
